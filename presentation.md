# Steps in PCB design and manufacture
  1. Specification collection
  1. Circuit design
  1. Tools presentation
  1. Components selection
  1. Creation of custom footprint
  1. Schematic organization
  1. PCB layout
  1. Submission.
  1. GOTO back to the step where you made the oblious mistake and reiterate the process

# Let's Build that

```python

    print("hi")
```


## How does learning AI help?

- Logical reasoning and Sequencing 
- Critical thinking
- Problem solving
- Mental Mathematics
    - The above skills are implicit skills that students learn along with AI. And this helps them in academics, life, etc.

# Extra 

The well known Pythagorean theorem $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ was  proved to be invalid for other exponents. 
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:
$$x^n + y^n = z^n$$

Can AI, help find near misses for this equation?
